## Phase P0 Test Suite – Comprehensive Analysis Proxy

Scope: Validate that the UI integrates with the standardized comprehensive analysis proxy and handles responses correctly.

Included tests:
- src/components/competitor-analysis/__tests__/ComprehensiveAnalysisButton.test.tsx
  - Success path: invokes comprehensive-competitor-analysis with { competitors: [companyName] }, resolves success, calls onAnalysisComplete
  - Failure path: success=false → shows failure state and does not call onAnalysisComplete

Execution: Included in jest test suite; run via `npm test` in CI.

Status: Added
