- No console.log in production logging; no hardcoded secrets/values
- No ‚Äòany‚Äô types; no weakening of security or RLS
- No manual timestamps for DB-managed columns

====================================================================
A) OBJECTIVES & SCOPE
====================================================================
- Remove all mock/placeholder data from competitor analysis flows
- Use top providers with task-based priorities and robust fallback logic
- Per-request cost tracking with org rollups; admin visibility
- Master company profiles periodically consolidated from all user analyses
- Frontend parity with backend features, with rich filtering/specificity controls
- Single coordinated release; maintain existing routes; no duplicates

====================================================================
B) SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
====================================================================
Core Edge Functions
- competitor-analysis (PRIMARY pipeline, authenticated)
- comprehensive-competitor-analysis (PUBLIC proxy to PRIMARY; no mock data)
- bulk-consolidate-companies (Master profile consolidation)

Shared Function Modules (Deno side)
- supabase/functions/shared/api-config.ts (Provider base URLs + defaults)
- supabase/functions/shared/api-providers.ts (Provider metadata)
- supabase/functions/shared/cost-tracking.ts (Cost logging helpers)

Frontend
- Hook: src/hooks/useCompetitorAnalysis.ts
- Services: src/services/api/apiOrchestrator.ts, src/services/api/centralizedApiManager.ts
- Master profile integration: src/services/api/masterProfileIntegrationService.ts
- Pages/Components: CompetitorAnalysisDashboard and tabs (New Analysis, Results, Saved)

Key DB Tables (public schema)
- competitor_analyses, master_company_profiles, api_keys, admin_api_keys, api_usage_costs
- organization_members, profiles (for org linkage)

====================================================================
C) CONTRACTS & INTERFACES (STRICT)
====================================================================
Types (reuse existing; do not alter shapes without approval)
- src/types/competitor/api-response.ts
  - interface AnalysisApiResponse { success: boolean; results: CompetitorApiResponse[]; session_id: string; error?: string }
- src/types/competitor/unified-types.ts
  - CompetitorAnalysisEntity et al. ‚Äì treat as canonical shapes in UI

Edge Function Invocation (Frontend)
- supabase.functions.invoke('competitor-analysis' | 'comprehensive-competitor-analysis', { body })
  - Body must include: { competitors: string[]; focusAreas?: string[]; session_id?: string; industry?: string }
  - competitor-analysis requires Authorization (verify_jwt = true)
  - comprehensive-competitor-analysis is a thin proxy to the primary pipeline and returns the same shape

Proxy Behavior (Implemented)
- comprehensive-competitor-analysis forwards body and Authorization to competitor-analysis and returns its response verbatim
- No random/placeholder fields are generated by the proxy

Master Consolidation
- bulk-consolidate-companies reads competitor_analyses, normalizes names, merges into master_company_profiles with provenance in source_analyses

====================================================================
D) PROVIDERS & FALLBACKS (DETAILED)
====================================================================
Supported Providers
- Web+Reasoning: Perplexity (sonar), OpenAI (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), Anthropic (sonnet-4-20250514), Gemini (1.5-pro)
- Fallback LLMs: Mistral, Cohere
- Signals: SerpAPI (search), NewsAPI (news), Alpha Vantage (financials)

Task Categories
- search (web retrieval), qa (structured analysis), enrichment (signals/news/financials summarization)

Priority Order (Default; configurable via preferences)
- search: Perplexity ‚Üí OpenAI ‚Üí Anthropic ‚Üí Gemini
- qa: OpenAI ‚Üí Anthropic ‚Üí Gemini ‚Üí Mistral
- enrichment: AlphaVantage/NewsAPI/SerpAPI (fetch) ‚Üí LLM summarization (OpenAI ‚Üí Anthropic)

Fallback Algorithm (Pseudo-code)
1) Resolve effective provider list per task using preferences (user override ‚Üí org ‚Üí default)
2) For provider in ordered list:
   - If circuit open for provider, continue
   - Try request with backoff policy
   - On success: record metrics/costs; return result
   - On failure (429/5xx): increment error rate; exponential backoff; try next provider
3) If all fail: return structured error with provider attempts and statuses

Circuit Breaker
- Track error_count in sliding window; open circuit after threshold (e.g., 5 fails/60s); half-open retry after cooldown (e.g., 30s)

Response Caching (Short-Lived)
- Cache by hash(provider+model+prompt) with TTL (e.g., 5m) to reduce costs on repeated prompts

====================================================================
E) COST TRACKING (PER REQUEST + ORG ROLLUP)
====================================================================
DB Changes (Migration Required)
- ALTER TABLE api_usage_costs ADD COLUMN organization_id uuid NULL;
- Create view v_org_monthly_costs (organization_id, month, provider, requests, tokens, cost_usd)
- Trigger set_api_usage_org_id(): on insert to api_usage_costs, set organization_id by looking up active membership for user_id

Function Changes
- supabase/functions/shared/cost-tracking.ts
  - For each external call, insert a row into api_usage_costs with fields:
    - user_id, organization_id, analysis_id, provider, model_used, tokens_used, cost_usd, latency, endpoint, success, metadata
  - Compute costs using helpers:
    - calculateOpenAICost, calculateAnthropicCost; add tables for Perplexity/Gemini/Mistral/Cohere per 1K tokens or per-call pricing
  - Remove reliance on shared/api-metrics.ts hardcoded cost paths for competitor analysis flows

Admin/Analytics UI
- Show per-user and per-org totals; filter by provider/date; include request counts, token counts, cost

====================================================================
F) API KEYS, TOGGLES, PRIORITIES (USER & ORG)
====================================================================
Storage
- api_keys (user scope); admin_api_keys (org/admin scope)

Preferences Table (Migration Required)
- provider_preferences: id uuid pk, user_id uuid nullable, organization_id uuid nullable, provider text, task_category text ('search'|'qa'|'enrichment'), enabled boolean default true, priority int default 100, created_at, updated_at
- Constraint: one of (user_id, organization_id) must be non-null
- Indexes: (user_id, provider, task_category), (organization_id, provider, task_category)

Key Resolution
- Effective key for a request: user key (if enabled) ‚Üí org key (if enabled) ‚Üí none (error)
- ‚ÄúUse org keys first‚Äù optional toggle to invert precedence (persist per user)

Validation
- validate-api-key edge function supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, Cohere, SerpAPI, NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage
- Store masked_key, key_prefix, last_validated; never log plaintext

UI Settings
- Provider Toggles per scope; drag/drop to set priority per task category; checkbox ‚ÄúUse org keys first‚Äù

====================================================================
G) MASTER COMPANY PROFILE ‚Äì CONSOLIDATION & ENRICHMENT
====================================================================
Scheduling (Migration Required)
- Enable pg_cron + pg_net
- Nightly at 03:00 local: cron job posts to https://jqbdjttdaihidoyalqvs.functions.supabase.co/bulk-consolidate-companies with service role Authorization

Merge Strategy
- Normalize company name; merge with rules: newest wins, higher completeness wins, higher confidence wins; keep source_analyses provenance

Enrichment on Read
- When running analysis: if master exists, fill gaps in UI result; annotate enriched fields and adjust confidence; do not overwrite user‚Äôs raw record

====================================================================
H) FRONTEND PARITY & CONTROLS (UI/UX)
====================================================================
useCompetitorAnalysis (Hook)
- Request enabled providers + priorities from CentralizedApiManager
- Pass task category per step (search, qa, enrichment)
- Maintain existing progress streaming, save/export

New Analysis Controls
- Focus areas (SWOT, pricing, tech stack, ICP, geography)
- Freshness window (30/90/365 days) applied to news/financials
- Source filters (news vendors, SERP country/language)
- Depth vs speed slider (affects model/tokens)

Results UI
- Provider badges, confidence adjustments, enrichment indicators
- Source citations and timestamps when available

Settings
- User + Org provider toggles, ordering; ‚ÄúUse org keys first‚Äù toggle

Accessibility & Theming
- Use design tokens; no hardcoded colors; responsive; proper landmarks and aria

====================================================================
I) SECURITY, RLS & COMPLIANCE
====================================================================
RLS (verify/update policies)
- api_usage_costs: user can see own rows; org admins can see org rows; service_role full
- provider_preferences: owner (user_id) can manage own; org admins can manage org; service_role full
- competitor_analyses/master_company_profiles: enforce existing policies; ensure user_id and organization_id are always set

Secrets Handling
- Never store plaintext API keys in logs; keep masked values and prefixes only
- Use Supabase secrets for function configs as needed

Timestamps
- Do not set DB-managed timestamps in code; rely on defaults/triggers

Types & Tests
- No any; Services use PostgrestResponseSuccess; tests use PostgrestResponse (per project rule)

====================================================================
J) DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP TASK LIST (EXECUTION ORDER)
====================================================================
P0 ‚Äì Mock Removal (Completed)
- comprehensive-competitor-analysis now proxies to competitor-analysis (no mock data)

P1 ‚Äì Database Migrations (prepare SQL via migration tool; do not run code changes before approval)
1) Add provider_preferences table with RLS and indexes
2) ALTER api_usage_costs ADD COLUMN organization_id uuid NULL; add indexes (user_id, organization_id, date)
3) Create view v_org_monthly_costs (organization_id, month, provider, requests, tokens, cost_usd)
4) Create trigger/function set_api_usage_org_id() to populate organization_id on insert
5) Enable pg_cron/pg_net; schedule bulk-consolidate-companies nightly at 03:00 via http_post

P2 ‚Äì Edge Functions & Shared Utilities
6) Update shared/cost-tracking.ts to write to api_usage_costs with accurate cost computations (OpenAI/Anthropic already implemented; add Perplexity/Gemini/Mistral/Cohere)
7) CentralizedApiManager: implement task-based routing, circuit breaker, backoff, short-lived cache
8) apiOrchestrator: pass task category per step; respect toggles/priorities; attach analysis_id to provider calls

P3 ‚Äì Frontend Updates
9) Settings UI: provider toggles for user/org, drag/drop priority, ‚ÄúUse org keys first‚Äù
10) New Analysis: add filters (focus areas, freshness, sources, depth/speed)
11) Results UI: provider badges, enrichment/confidence annotations, citations
12) Admin dashboard: org/user cost charts and summaries

P4 ‚Äì Testing & QA
13) Unit tests: orchestrator fallbacks, key resolution, cost logging, enrichment logic
14) E2E: happy path; provider failure; missing keys; org-overrides; scheduled consolidation effects
15) Types: verify service/test response types per rules; zero any types

P5 ‚Äì Release
16) Run migrations (tool-approved), deploy functions, deploy frontend
17) Smoke tests; enable cron; monitor logs; prepare rollback steps

Rollback
- Revert migrations and disable cron; revert functions and frontend deploy
