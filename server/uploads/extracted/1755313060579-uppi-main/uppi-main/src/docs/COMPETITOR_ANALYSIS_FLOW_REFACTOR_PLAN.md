# Competitor Analysis Flow Refactoring Plan
**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Status:** Assessment Complete - Action Required  
**Priority:** HIGH - Critical Production Issues Identified

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive testing of the competitor analysis flow, several critical issues have been identified that require immediate attention. The flow has gaps in data persistence, prompt visibility, error handling, and provider integration that impact the user experience and data integrity.

## Current Flow Assessment

### âœ… Working Components
1. **Authentication & Authorization** - Fully functional
2. **API Key Validation** - Working with proper error handling
3. **Database Connectivity** - Connection established and tested
4. **Progress Tracking Setup** - Real-time updates functioning
5. **Basic UI Flow** - Components render and respond correctly

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. AI Analysis Pipeline Gaps
- **Issue**: Limited visibility into actual AI prompts being sent
- **Impact**: Debugging and optimization difficulties
- **Evidence**: No prompt logging in current edge functions

#### 2. Data Persistence Inconsistencies
- **Issue**: Analysis results sometimes not saved to database
- **Impact**: Users lose analysis data, poor reliability
- **Evidence**: Edge function logs show processing but no DB writes

#### 3. Provider Integration Problems
- **Issue**: Only OpenAI integration fully working
- **Impact**: Limited analysis depth, single point of failure
- **Evidence**: Anthropic and Perplexity providers return "API key not configured"

#### 4. Error Handling Fragmentation
- **Issue**: Inconsistent error reporting across pipeline stages
- **Impact**: Difficult troubleshooting, poor user experience
- **Evidence**: Some failures silent, others overly verbose

#### 5. Performance Monitoring Gaps
- **Issue**: No real-time cost tracking or token usage monitoring
- **Impact**: Uncontrolled costs, no optimization insights
- **Evidence**: Cost calculations exist but not exposed to admins

## Detailed Refactoring Plan
