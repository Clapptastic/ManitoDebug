# TypeScript Build Error Fix Plan - May 21, 2025

## Identified Issues

1. The main issue is with JSX syntax in `.ts` files. TypeScript expects JSX to be in `.tsx` files only.
2. There are several functions in `renderUtils.ts` using JSX syntax which is causing build errors.

## Resolution Plan

### 1. Fix `renderUtils.ts`

- Remove JSX syntax from this file
- Convert the functions that need to return React elements to return string values instead
- Create a new `renderUtilsJsx.tsx` file to hold the React component versions of these functions

### 2. Create Specialized Utility Functions

- Create clear separation between non-JSX and JSX utility functions
- Ensure all React rendering logic is in `.tsx` files
- Keep pure string/data manipulation in `.ts` files

### 3. Update Component Imports

- Update all components using these utilities to import from the correct files

### 4. Testing Strategy

- Test each component that was using the utilities to ensure they render correctly
- Verify no build errors related to JSX syntax in `.ts` files
- Ensure all component functionality remains intact

## Implementation Details

1. Modified `renderUtils.ts` to remove all JSX syntax
2. Created `renderUtilsJsx.tsx` with React-specific rendering functions
3. Updated components like `StrengthsWeaknesses.tsx` to use the appropriate utilities
4. Fixed `CompetitorMetadata.tsx` to use the correct `formatDate` function

## Future Recommendations

1. Always use `.tsx` extension for files containing JSX
2. Maintain clear separation between React component logic and pure utility functions
3. Consider using a linting rule to prevent JSX in `.ts` files

## Completion Status

- [x] Fixed `renderUtils.ts`
- [x] Created `renderUtilsJsx.tsx`
- [x] Updated affected components
- [x] Completed documentation
