## Overview

The Admin Panel provides administrators and super-administrators with access to system management tools, monitoring features, and configuration options. This interface gives authorized users the ability to manage the application, monitor system health, and configure settings.

## Access Levels

- **Admin**: Has access to most administrative features but with some limitations
- **Super Admin**: Has unrestricted access to all administrative features, including sensitive operations

## Features

### 1. System Health Monitoring

The System Health page provides real-time metrics and status information about the application's components, services, and infrastructure.

- **Component Status**: View operational status of all system components
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, and other resource usage
- **System Alerts**: View and manage system alerts and notifications
- **System Logs**: Access application logs for troubleshooting

### 2. User Management

The User Management page allows administrators to manage user accounts, roles, and permissions.

- **User List**: View all registered users with filtering and search capabilities
- **Role Assignment**: Assign and modify user roles (admin, super_admin, etc.)
- **User Details**: View user activity and account information

### 3. API Management

The API Management page provides tools to configure API integrations and view API metrics.

- **API Keys**: View and manage API keys for various services
- **API Usage Metrics**: Monitor API usage, costs, and rate limits
- **Provider Configuration**: Configure third-party API services

### 4. Database Schema Viewer

The Database Schema Viewer allows administrators to explore the database structure.

- **Schema Selection**: Browse different database schemas
- **Table Explorer**: View tables, columns, constraints, and indexes
- **Policy Viewer**: View row-level security policies

### 5. Affiliate Management

The Affiliate Management page provides tools to manage affiliate programs and links.

- **Conversion Tracking**: Track conversions and revenue

### 6. Analytics Dashboard

The Analytics Dashboard provides insights into application usage and performance.

- **Usage Metrics**: View application usage statistics
- **User Activity**: Monitor user engagement and activity
- **Performance Indicators**: Track key performance indicators

### 7. Package Updates

Super Administrators can manage system package updates.

- **Update Status**: View available updates for system packages
- **Update History**: Review history of past updates
- **One-Click Updates**: Perform package updates with minimal downtime

## Navigation

The Admin Panel uses a sidebar navigation system with sections organized by functionality. Certain menu items are only available to Super Administrators and will be hidden for regular Admin users.

## API Endpoints

The Admin Panel uses the following API endpoints:

- `/api/admin/system-health`: Retrieve system health information
- `/api/admin/users`: Manage user accounts
- `/api/admin/api-keys`: Manage API keys
- `/api/admin/analytics`: Retrieve analytics data

## Database Tables

The Admin Panel interacts with several database tables:

- `system_components_status`: Stores health status of system components
- `system_performance_metrics`: Stores system performance metrics
- `system_alerts`: Stores system alerts and notifications
- `platform_roles`: Stores user roles and permissions

## Security Considerations

The Admin Panel implements several security measures:

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different roles have different levels of access
2. **Secure API Endpoints**: All API endpoints require proper authentication
3. **Audit Logging**: All administrative actions are logged for accountability
4. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated to prevent security vulnerabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Access Denied**: Ensure the user has the correct role assigned
2. **Data Not Loading**: Check network connectivity and API endpoints
3. **System Health Errors**: Investigate component-specific issues based on error messages

### Getting Help

For assistance with the Admin Panel, contact the system administrator or refer to the internal documentation.
