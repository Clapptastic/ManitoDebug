## Edge Functions

### Current Implementation
- Edge functions exist for competitor analysis (`analyze-competitor`)
- Configuration exists in `supabase/config.toml`
- JWT verification is enabled

### Issues Found
- Edge function error handling could be improved
- Some edge functions lack proper CORS headers
- Missing standard response format across functions
- Potential security issues with direct API key access

### Recommendations
1. Implement consistent error handling across all edge functions
2. Add standardized CORS headers to all edge functions
3. Create a common response format for all edge functions
4. Implement proper secret management for API keys
5. Add request validation middleware

## Database Schema & Migration

### Current Implementation
- Multiple competitor analysis related tables
- Complex schema with many fields
- Migration files exist but might need validation

### Issues Found
- Some tables have nullable fields that should be required
- Potential data integrity issues between related tables
- Inconsistencies in database column naming (snake_case vs camelCase)
- Some tables might be missing proper indexes

### Recommendations
1. Review nullable columns and add constraints where appropriate
2. Add missing foreign key constraints
3. Standardize column naming conventions
4. Add necessary indexes on frequently queried columns
5. Consider adding database triggers for audit logging

## Row Level Security (RLS)

### Current Implementation
- RLS policies exist for competitor_analyses table
- Basic policies for CRUD operations

### Issues Found
- Inconsistent RLS policy application across tables
- Some tables might be missing RLS entirely
- Potential security holes with incomplete policies
- Lack of separate policies for different user roles

### Recommendations
1. Apply consistent RLS policies across all tables
2. Ensure all user-owned data has proper RLS protection
3. Implement role-based RLS policies for admin operations
4. Add security definer functions to avoid RLS recursion
5. Test RLS policies thoroughly with different user roles

## Vector Embeddings

### Current Implementation
- Vector embeddings are used for code search functionality
- Table `code_embeddings` exists with vector fields
- Function `match_code_embeddings` implemented

### Issues Found
- Lack of proper indexing for vector search
- Potential performance issues with large embedding collections
- No caching mechanism for frequent searches
- Potentiial permission issues with vector search

### Recommendations
1. Add proper vector indexes (ivfflat or hnsw) for embedding tables
2. Implement caching for frequent vector searches
3. Ensure proper RLS policies for embedding access
4. Consider batch processing for embedding generation
5. Optimize vector similarity queries

## API Key Management

### Current Implementation
- API keys stored in `api_keys` table
- Status tracking in `api_status_checks` table
- Validation mechanism through edge functions

### Issues Found
- Potential security issues with API key storage
- Inconsistent API key status tracking
- API key validation not centralized
- Error handling for invalid keys could be improved

### Recommendations
1. Review API key storage security (consider encryption)
2. Implement centralized key validation service
3. Add proper key rotation mechanisms
4. Improve error handling for invalid or expired keys
5. Add usage tracking and rate limiting

## Supabase Client Usage

### Current Implementation
- Supabase client initialized in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- Various service files using the client for database operations

### Issues Found
- Inconsistent error handling across service files
- Type issues with Supabase responses
- Lack of retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Potential performance issues with query design

### Recommendations
1. Implement consistent error handling wrapper
2. Fix type issues with Supabase response handling
3. Add retry mechanisms for transient failures
4. Optimize query patterns to reduce database load
5. Consider implementing connection pooling

## Error Handling

### Current Implementation
- Various error handling approaches across files
- Some use try/catch blocks, others don't
- Inconsistent error logging and user feedback

### Issues Found
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Incomplete error logging
- User-facing error messages need improvement
- Network error handling needs enhancement

### Recommendations
1. Implement centralized error handling system
2. Standardize error logging format and level
3. Improve user-facing error messages and handling
4. Add specific handling for network and Supabase errors
5. Consider implementing error boundaries at component level

## Real-time Subscriptions

### Current Implementation
- Some components use Supabase's real-time functionality
- Subscriptions to database changes

### Issues Found
- Potential memory leaks from unremoved subscriptions
- Inconsistent channel naming
- Subscriptions might not be properly cleaned up
- Lack of error handling for subscription failures

### Recommendations
1. Ensure all subscriptions are properly cleaned up in useEffect cleanup
2. Standardize channel naming conventions
3. Implement error handling for subscription failures
4. Consider using a subscription manager/abstraction
5. Monitor subscription performance and optimize as needed

## Critical Fixes

These issues should be addressed immediately:

1. **Database Permissions**: Ensure all tables have proper RLS policies
2. **API Key Security**: Review and enhance API key storage security
3. **Edge Function CORS**: Add proper CORS headers to all edge functions
4. **Type Errors**: Fix TypeScript errors in Supabase response handling
5. **Memory Leaks**: Ensure all real-time subscriptions are properly cleaned up

## Optimization Recommendations

These changes will improve performance and maintenance:

1. **Query Optimization**: Review and optimize database queries
2. **Vector Indexing**: Add proper indexes for vector search
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Error Handling**: Create a centralized error handling system
5. **Connection Management**: Implement better connection management
6. **Code Organization**: Refactor Supabase-related code into more modular structure
7. **Documentation**: Improve documentation of Supabase usage and patterns
8. **Type Safety**: Enhance type definitions for Supabase operations
9. **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for Supabase operations
10. **Monitoring**: Implement proper monitoring and logging for Supabase operations
