Overall Status: On track. Core admin/feature-flag/system-health work complete; analysis resiliency in progress.

Completed

- System health permission fix via get_system_health_overview RPC
- Edge functions audit/hardening (JWT, role checks, secure RPCs)
- Tests added for Admin nav and Settings Feature Flags tab
- Analysis runs retention trigger (keep last 5 per user/run_type)
- Client auth + RLS adherence for analysis_runs

In Progress
- Edge function resiliency for aggregate-analysis (graceful partial results)

Not Started

Next Steps
- Finish aggregate-analysis resiliency path
- Implement empty-states and toasts on detail page
