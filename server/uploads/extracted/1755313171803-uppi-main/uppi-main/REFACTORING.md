## Type System Improvements

The refactoring has significantly improved the type system by:

1. **Centralized Type Definitions**: All core types are defined in dedicated files for better organization
2. **Consistent Interfaces**: Core data structures have consistent interfaces with proper typing
3. **Proper Exports**: Types are exported correctly to prevent import errors
4. **Type Guards**: Added robust type guards for runtime type checking
5. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive JSDoc comments for better developer experience

## Data Visualization Improvements

The refactoring has added powerful visualization components:

1. **Competitor Comparison**: Charts for comparing competitor metrics
2. **SWOT Analysis**: Visual representation of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
3. **Market Trends**: Time-series charts for visualizing market trends
4. **Reusable Charts**: Flexible chart components for various data types

## Edge Function Implementation

All required edge functions have been implemented:

1. **API Key Validation**: Secure validation of API keys
2. **Trend Analysis**: Analysis of market trends
3. **Pricing Analysis**: Evaluation of pricing strategies
4. **Geographic Analysis**: Regional market analysis
5. **Market Size Calculation**: Estimation of market size and growth

## Next Steps

1. Complete authentication and file upload hooks
2. Implement notification system
3. Finalize end-to-end tests
4. Add security features and documentation
5. Optimize performance and implement caching
