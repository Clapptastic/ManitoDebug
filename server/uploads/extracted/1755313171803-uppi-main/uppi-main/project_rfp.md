# Request for Proposal: Full-Stack React Application Debugging & Optimization

## Project Overview

We are seeking an experienced full-stack developer to debug and optimize our React/TypeScript application that currently has several critical issues affecting functionality. The application is a SaaS platform for entrepreneurs with AI-powered tools, analytics, and business development features. It uses Supabase for authentication and database operations.

## Current Issues

The application currently has the following issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Authentication Loop & Role-Based Access Issues**
   - Authentication system gets stuck in loops
   - Role-based access (admin/super admin routes) not functioning properly
   - Type errors involving `hasRole` functionality

2. **TypeScript Type Definition Problems**
   - Inconsistent type definitions across the codebase
   - Multiple unhandled build errors related to TypeScript types
   - Missing or incorrectly defined interfaces/types

3. **Component Implementation Issues**
   - Missing props in several components
   - Incorrectly implemented components causing rendering failures
   - Incorrect prop types being passed to components

4. **Supabase Integration Problems**
   - Authentication integration not following best practices
   - Session management issues
   - Inconsistent API call patterns

5. **Routing & Navigation Errors**
   - Redirection loops in protected routes
   - Inconsistent route protection implementation
   - Missing route parameters

## Scope of Work

### 1. Authentication System Overhaul

- Debug and fix the authentication loop issues
- Properly implement role-based access control system
- Ensure Supabase authentication follows best practices
- Fix the `hasRole` functionality across the application
- Implement proper session persistence and management
- Ensure consistent error handling for authentication processes

### 2. Type System Standardization & Fixes

- Create consistent type definitions across the application
- Fix all TypeScript errors identified in the build logs
- Ensure proper typing for API responses and state management
- Document the type system architecture for future maintenance
- Implement type guards where necessary
- Fix casing issues in import paths

### 3. Component Refactoring & Fixes

- Fix all component prop type issues
- Ensure components properly handle loading states
- Implement error boundaries for critical components
- Fix or reimplement components with rendering issues
- Ensure consistent component API across the application
- Add proper documentation to components

### 4. Supabase Integration Optimization

- Ensure Supabase client is properly configured
- Implement proper error handling for Supabase operations
- Optimize database queries and edge functions
- Fix API service implementation to follow best practices
- Ensure proper typing of Supabase responses

### 5. Routing & Navigation Fixes

- Fix protected route implementation
- Ensure consistent route protection behavior
- Fix navigation issues in admin and user routes
- Implement proper role-based route protection
- Add proper loading states during route transitions

### 6. Testing & Documentation

- Add unit tests for critical functionality
- Document the authentication flow and role-based access system
- Create development guidelines for maintaining type safety
- Add inline documentation to complex functions
- Update README with development setup instructions

## Technical Stack

The application is built with:
