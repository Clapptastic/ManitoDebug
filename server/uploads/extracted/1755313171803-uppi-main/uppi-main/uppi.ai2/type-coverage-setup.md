# Type Coverage Setup

To implement type coverage checking in your project, follow these steps:

## 1. Install type-coverage package

```bash
npm install --save-dev type-coverage
```

## 2. Add scripts to package.json

Add the following scripts to your package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "type-coverage": "type-coverage --detail",
    "type-coverage:strict": "type-coverage --strict --at-least 90"
  }
}
```

## 3. Create GitHub Action Workflow

Create a file at `.github/workflows/type-check.yml`:

```yaml
name: Type Check
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  type-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run type check
        run: npm run type-check
      - name: Check type coverage
        run: npm run type-coverage:strict
```

## 4. Run Type Coverage Locally

Run the following command to check your current type coverage:

```bash
npm run type-coverage
```

This will output details about your type coverage, including:
- Overall percentage of code covered by types
- List of files with `any` types
- Locations of `any` types in your code

## 5. Using Strict Mode

For stricter type checking, you can run:

```bash
npm run type-coverage:strict
```

This will ensure your project maintains at least 90% type coverage and will fail if it drops below that threshold.

## 6. Monitoring Type Coverage Over Time

Track your type coverage progress over time and gradually increase the minimum threshold as you improve your types.

Initial goal: 80% coverage
Medium-term goal: 90% coverage
Long-term goal: 95%+ coverage
